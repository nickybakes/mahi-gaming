# Game and Tool Development at MahiGaming
While working at MahiGaming from 2024-2026, I shipped 8 games and developed multiple internal tools to aid with and speed up development. Because of my NDA, I cannot provide explicit details or screenshots.

# Game Mechanics and Features
- Developed in Typescript within an internal game engine
- Worked with lead game designers to implement in-game mechanics and features
- Logic needed to sync with online services across many different iGaming platforms
- Game Logic needed to be performant on a large variety of devices
- Developed automated testing for features for QA teams to utilize

# Internal Tools
While working on shipping games, I would take note of pain points inthe development process, and in between projects I would take in feedback from internal teams to develop tools that solved these issues and sped up our development process.

Advanced Search
-
- Users can quickly search through all game objects, logic nodes, assets, and resources based on object type, properties, and references
- The Search tool would automatically organize results based on their flowgraph, type, and search relevancy
- User can select searched objects or instantly jump to where that object is created and referenced in the game logic for debugging
- Massively sped up our debugging process

Copy, Cut, and Paste for Flowgraphs
-
- We utilize an internally developed flowgraph system for game logic, though it was clunky and slow to utilize
- Based on other flowgraphs and editors I have used, I implemented functionality such as Copy, Cut, and Paste
- Users can now select groups of nodes and copy, cut, and paste to more easily and more quickly create, duplicate, and organize game logic
- Massively sped up and eased our development process
